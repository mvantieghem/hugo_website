You're an R user who is looking to make a professional webpage that: \
a. Takes advantage of [Hugo website themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/)\
b. Avoids learning html or java  \
b. Can be hosted on a free domain [(Github Pages)](https://pages.github.com/) 

*Note: This tutorial assumes that you have basic proficiency using Github, R studio, and github repositories with R projects.* 
If you aren't comfortable with this yet, start [here](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html) instead.
