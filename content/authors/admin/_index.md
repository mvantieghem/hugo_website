I research early environments, brain development, and mental health. I recently completed my PhD at Columbia University, where I studied neurobiological development and motivated behavior in children and adolescents with history of early adversity. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the NYU Department of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, where I examine how the early environment influences prenatal and postnatal brain development and later mental health outcomes.

I also teach R programming in both workshops and courses, and I am a member of [R ladies in NYC](https://www.rladiesnyc.org/). 

Outside the lab, I'm an avid cyclist and also [blog](https://www.nyccwomensracing.com/blog) about concussion awareness and prevention.
